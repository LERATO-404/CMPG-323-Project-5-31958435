# Reporting and Monitoring 
Connected Office Initiative (COI) encapsulates the use of IoT devices
within the network placed over the office building, to collecte and share
data that these devices gather. In this project I create a Report in Power BIwith three pages:
* High-level Metrics - contains the important metrics of the data such as the number of devices in a category/zone
* Device Monitoring - contains the granula details about all the devices or the device drilled from the high-level metric 
* Device Registration - contains details details about all the registered devices or the a sigle device drilled from the high-level metric 

These pages showcase the data that these devices share.  The report can be shared with 
different stakeholders to see important information about the status of the IoT devices 
registration on verious platform.
